Lighting and shadow casting algorithms can be very roughly divided into two categories; Direct
Illumination and Global Illumination. Many people will be familiar with the former
category, and the problems associated with it. This article will briefly discuss the
two approaches, then give an in-depth study of one Global Illumination method, Radiosity.

</p><p></p><hr><p>

</p><h2>Direct Illumination</h2>
Direct Illumination is a term that covers the principal lighting methods used by old
school rendering engines such as 3D Studio and POV. A scene consists of two types of
entity: Objects and Lights. Lights cast light onto Objects, unless there is another
Object in the way, in which case a shadow is left behind.<p>

There are all sorts of techniques under this heading: Shadow Volumes, Z-Buffer methods,
Ray Tracing . . . But as a general rule, they all suffer from similar problems, and
all require some kind of fudge in order to overcome them.

</p><h3>Direct Illumination Problems and Advantages</h3>

The most important thing to consider is that, while these methods can produce hyper-realistic images,
they can only do this when given a scene with point light sources, and perfectly shiny or perfectly
diffuse objects. Now, unless you are some kind of rich simpleton, your house probably isn't full of
perfectly shiny spheres and point light sources. In fact, unless you live in a universe with
completely different physics, your house probably contains hardly any super-sharp shadows.<p>

It it quite common for people to claim that ray tracers and other renderers produce 'photo-realistic'
results. But imagine someone were to show you a typical ray traced image, and claim it was a photo.
You would claim in return that they were blind or lying.</p><p>

It should also be noted that, in the real world, it is still possible to see objects that are not
directly lit; shadows are never completely black. Direct Illumination renderers try to handle such
situations by adding an Ambient Light term. Thus all objects receive a minimum amount of uni-directional
light.</p><p>

</p><p></p><hr><p>

</p><h2>Global Illumination</h2>
Global illumination methods try to overcome some of the problems associated with Ray Tracing. While
a Ray Tracer tends to simulate light reflecting only once off each diffuse surface, global illumination
renderers simulate very many reflections of light around a scene. <br>
While each object in a Ray Traced scene must be lit by some light source for it to be visible, an
object in a Globally Illuminated scene may be lit simply by it's surroundings.<br>
The reason this makes a difference will become clear soon.

<h3>Global Illumination Problems and Advantages</h3>
Images produced by global illumination methods can look very convincing indeed; in a league of their own, leaving
old skool renderers to churn out sad cartoons. But, and it's a big 'but': 'BUT!' they are slower. Just as once you
may have left your ray tracer all day, and come back to be thrilled by the image it produced, you will be doing
the same here.

	<h4>Lighting a simple scene with Direct Lighting</h4>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I modeled this simple scene in 3D Studio. I wanted the room to look as if it was lit by the sun shining in through the window.<p>

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I set up a spotlight to shine in. When I rendered it, the entire room was pitch black, except for a couple of patches on
	the floor that the light reached. <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning up the Ambient Light simply caused the room to appear a uniform grey, except for the uniformly red floor, and light patches.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding a point light source in the middle of the room brought out the details, but the scene doesn't have that bright glow that you expect from a sunlit room.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I turned the background colour to white, to give the appearance of a bright sky.

</p><h2>The Workings of a Radiosity Renderer</h2>

Clear your mind of anything you know about normal rendering methods. Your previous experiences may simply distract you.<p>

I would now like to ask an expert on shadows, who will explain to you everything they know about the subject. My expert
is a tiny patch of paint on the wall in front of me.</p><p>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>hugo:</b> "Why is it that you are in shadow, when a very similar patch of paint near you is in light?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>paint:</b> "What do you mean?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>hugo:</b> "How is it you know when to be in shadow, and when not to be? What do you know about shadow casting algorithms? You're just some paint."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>paint:</b> "Listen mate. I don't know what you're talking about. My job is a simple one: any light that hits me, I scatter back."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>hugo:</b> "Any light?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>paint:</b> "Yes, any light at all. I don't have a preference."</p><p>


So there you have it. The basic premise of Radiosity. Any light that hits a surface is reflected back into the scene. That's <i>any</i>
light. Not just light that's come directly from light sources. <i>Any</i> light. That's how paint in the real world thinks, and that's
how the radiosity renderer will work.</p><p>

In my next article, I will be explaining how you can make your own talking paint.</p><p>


So, the basic principal behind the radiosity renderer is to remove the distinction between objects and light sources. Now, you can
consider everything to be a potential light source. <br>

Anything that is visible is either emitting or reflecting light, i.e. it is a source of light. A Light Source. Everything you can
see around you is a light source. And so, when we are considering how much light is reaching any part of a scene, we must take care
to add up light from all possible light sources.

</p><h2>Basic Premises:</h2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>1:</b> There is no difference between light sources and objects.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>2:</b> A surface in the scene is lit by all parts of the scene that are visible to it.<br>
<p>

Now that you have the important things in mind. I will take you through the process of performing Radiosity on a scene.

<h3>A Simple Scene</h3>
We begin with a simple scene: a room with three windows. There are a couple of pillars and some alcoves, to provide interesting
shadows.<p>

It will be lit by the scenery outside the windows, which I will assume is completely dark, except for a small, bright sun.

<h3>View from a patch</h3>
  Placing my eye very carefully on the patch, and looking outwards, I can see what it sees. The room is very dark, because no light has
  entered yet. But I have drawn in the edges for your benefit.<p>
  By adding together all the light it sees, we can calculate the total amount of light from the scene reaching the patch. I'll refer to
  this as the total <b>incident</b> light from now on.</p><p>

  This patch can only see the room and the darkness outside. Adding up the incident light, we would see that no light is arriving here.  This patch is darkly lit.

Pick a patch a little further down the pillar. This patch can see the bright sun outside the window.  This time, adding up the

<h3>Lighting on the Pillar</h3>
Having repeated this process for all the patches, and
added up the incident light each time, we can look back at the pillar
and see what the lighting is like.<p>

The patches nearer the top of the pillar, which could not see the
sun, are in shadow, and those that can are brightly lit. Those that
could see the sun partly obscured by the edge of the window are only
dimly lit.</p><p>

And so Radiosity proceeds in much the same fashion. As you have seen,
shadows naturally appear in parts of the scene that cannot see a
source of light.

<h3>Entire Room Lit: 1<sup>st</sup> Pass</h3>
Repeating the process for every patch in the room, gives us this
scene. Everything is completely dark, except for surfaces that have
received light from the sun.<p>

So, this doesn't look like a very well lit scene. Ignore the fact
that the lighting looks blocky; we can fix that by using many more
patches. What's important to notice is that the room is completely
dark, except for those areas that can see the sun. At the moment
it's no improvement over any other renderer.

Well, it doesn't
end here. Now that some parts of the room are brightly lit, they
have become sources of light themselves, and could well cast light
onto other parts of the scene.

This time, when you calculate the incident light on each patch in the scene, many patches that

<h3>Entire Room Lit: 3<sup>rd</sup> Pass</h3>
The third pass produces the effect of light having reflected twice in the scene. Everything looks
pretty much the same, but is slightly brighter.<p>

The next pass only looks a little brighter than the last, and even the 16 <sup>th</sup> is not a
lot different. There's not much point in doing any more passes after that.</p><p>

The radiosity process slowly converges on a solution. Each pass is a little less different than the
last, until eventually it becomes stable. Depending on the complexity of the scene, and the
lightness of the surfaces, it may take a few, or a few thousand passes. It's really up to you when
to stop it, and call it done.

</p><h2>The Algorithm In More Detail: Patches</h2>
<p>
<u><font size="+1">Emmision</font></u><br>
Though I have said that we'll consider lightsources and objects to be basically
the same, there must obviously be some source of light in the scene. In the
real world, some objects do emit light, and some don't, and all objects absorb
light to some extent. We must somehow distinguish between parts of the scene
that emit light, and parts that don't. We shall handle this in radiosity by
saying that all patches emit light, but for most patches, their light emmision
is zero. This property of a patch, I'll call <b>emmision</b>.

</p><p>
<u><font size="+1">Reflectance</font></u><br>
When light hits a surface, some light is absorbed and becomes heat, (we can
ignore this) and the rest is reflected. I'll call the proportion of light
reflected by a patch <b>reflectance</b>.

</p><p>
<u><font size="+1">Incident and Excident Light</font></u><br>
During each pass, it will be necessary to remember two other things, how
much light is arriving at each patch, and how much light is leaving each patch.
I'll call these two, <b>incident_light</b> and <b>excident_light</b>. The
excident light is the visible property of a patch. When we look at a patch,
it is the excident light that we're seeing.
</p><p>


</p><pre>    <b>incident_light</b> = sum of all light that a patch can see
    <b>excident_light</b> = (<b>incident_light</b>*<b>reflectance</b>) + <b>emmision</b>
	
</pre>

<p>
<u><font size="+1">Patch structure</font></u><br>
Now that we know all the necessary properties of a patch, it's time to
define a patch. Later, I'll explain the details of the four variables.

</p><pre>  structure <b>PATCH</b>
    <b>emmision</b>
    <b>reflectance</b>
    <b>incident</b>
    <b>excident</b>
  end structure
</pre>

<p></p><hr><p>

Now that I've explained the basics of the algorithm, I'll tell it again in
pseudocode form, to make it concrete. Clearly this is still quite high level,
but I'll explain in more detail later.

To begin with, all patches are dark, except those that are emmiting light.

<font size="+1"><u>Passes Loop:</u></font><br>
The code repeats this loop as many times as is necessary to produce acceptable

<font size="+1"><u>each patch collects light from the scene</u></font><br>
As I explained earlier in the article, each patch is lit by what it can

this in more detail in the next section.

</p><h1><u>Implementing Radiosity:</u> Hemicubes</h1>


The first thing we'll have to deal with, in implementing radiosity, is to solve
the problem of looking at the world from the point of view of each patch.
So far in this article I have used a fish-eye view to represent a patch's eye
view of the scene, but this isn't easy or practical. There is a much better
way, the Hemicube!<p>

<td align="left" valign="top">
<font size="+1">The Hemisphere</font><br>
Imagine a fish eye view wrapped onto a hemisphere. Place the hemisphere over
a patch (left: red square), and from that patch's point of view, the scene wrapped on the inside of the hemisphere looks just like the scene from it's point of view.
There's no difference.<p>

Placing a camera in the middle of the hemisphere, you can see that the view
looks just like any other rendering of the scene (right).</p><p>

If you could find a way to render a fisheye view easily, then you could just
sum up the brightness of every pixel to calculate the total incident light
on the patch. However, it's not easy to render a fisheye view, and so some
other way must be found to calculate the incident light.

Surprisingly (or unsurprisingly, depending on how mathematical you are) a
hemicube looks exactly the same as a hemisphere from the patch's point of view.

<center>
<img src="./TGLTLSBFSSP  Radiosity_files/fold_2.gif" width="765" height="256" alt="Unfolding Hemicube">
</center>
Imagine unfolding the hemicube. What are you left with? One square image
and four rectangular images. The square image in the center is a rendering
from the point of view of the patch, looking directly forwards. The other four
parts of the hemicube are the views looking 90° up, down, left and
right.<p>

So, you can easily produce each of these images by placing a camera on a
patch, and render it pointing forwards, up, down, left and right. The
four side images are, of course, cut in half, and so, only half a rendering
is required there.

</p><p>
</p><h2>Compensating for the hemicube's shape</h2>

      This is view of 3 spheres, rendered with a 90° field of view. All three spheres are the same distance from the camera, but because of the properties of perspective transformation, objects at the edge of the image appear spretched and larger than ones in the middle.<p>

	  If this was the middle image of a hemicube, and the three spheres were light sources, then those near the edge would cast more light onto the patch than they should. This would be inaccurate, and so we must compensate for this.</p><p>

	  If you were to use a hemicube to calculate the total incident light falling on a patch, and just added together the values of all the pixel rendered in the hemicube, you would be giving an unfair weight to objects lying at the corners of the hemicube.  They would appear to cast more light onto the patch.</p><p>

	  To compensate for this, it is necessary to 'dim' the pixels at the edges and corners, so that all objects contribute equally to
	  the incident light, no matter where they may lie in the hemicube. Rather than give a full explanation, I'm just going to tell

</p><h2>Calculating the Incident Light</h2>
This procedure takes a point in the scene (usually a patch), along with a normal vector, and calculates the total ammount
of light arriving at that point. <p>

First, it renders the 5 faces of the hemicube using the procedure <font face="courier"><b>RenderView</b>(point, vector, part)</font>.
This procedure takes as it's arguments a point, telling it where the camera should be for the rendering, a vector, telling it what
direction the camera should be pointing in, and another argument telling it which part of the final image should be rendered. These
5 images are stored in hemicube structure called <b>H</b> (left column of images below).</p><p>

Once the hemicube <b>H</b> has been rendered, it is multiplied by the multiplier hemicube <b>M</b> (middle column of images below), and the result is stored in the hemicube <b>R</b> (right column of images below).</p><p>

Then the total value of the light in <b>R</b> is added up and divided by the number of pixels in a hemicube. This should give the total
amount of light arriving at the point in question.</p><p>

</p><h2>Increasing the accuracy of the solution</h2>
You'll be thinking to yourself, 'damn, this seems like a whole lot of rendering. A very processor intensive way of doing things.'
You'd be right of course. Basically you have to render a texture mapped scene many thousands of times.
<p>

Fortunately, this is something people have been doing since the dawn of time. Um, since the dawn of the raster display, and since
then there has been much work put into rendering texture mapped scenes as fast as possible. I won't go into a whole lot of detail
here, I'm really not the person best qualified to be talking about optimised rendering. My own renderer is so slow you have to
use cussing words to describe it. The algorithm also lends itself well to optimisation with standard 3D graphics hardware, though
you have do some fiddling and chopping to get it to render (3x32) bit textures.
</p><p>

The speed improvement I'm going to discuss in this article does not concern optimising the actual rendering of the hemicubes, but rather
reducing the number of hemicubes that need to be rendered.

You will, of course, have noticed that the light maps illustrated in the black and white renderings above were somewhat blocky, low
resolution. Don't fear, their resolution can be increased as far as you want.

	  Take a look at the surface on the left, outlined in red. The lighting is basically very simple, there's a bright bit, and a less
	  bright bit, with a fairly sharp edge between the two.  To reproduce the edge sharply, you would normally need a high resolution
	  light map and, therefore, have to render very many hemicubes. But it hardly seems worthwhile rendering so many hemicubes just to
	  fill in the bright or less-bright areas which are little more than solid colour. It would be more worthwhile to render a lot of
	  hemicubes near the sharp edge, and just a few in the other areas.<p>

	  Well, it is possible, and quite straightforward. The algorithm I will describe below will render a few hemicubes scattered across
	  the surface, then render more near the edges, and use linear interpolation to fill in the rest of the light map.

You should be able to see, from the maps on the left, that most of the light map was produced using linear interpolation. In fact, from
a total of 1769 pixels, only 563 were calculated by hemicube, and 1206 by linear interpolation. Now, since rendering a hemicube takes
a very long time indeed, compared to the negligable time required to do a linear interpolation, it represents a speed improvement
of about 60% !</p><p>

Now, this method is not perfect, and it can occasionally miss very small details in a light map, but it's pretty good in most situations.
There's a simple way to help it catch small details, but I'll leave that up to your own imagination.

It is generally considered that Radiosity does not deal well with point light sources. This is true to some extent, but it is not
impossible to have reasonable point light sources in your scene. <p>

I tried adding bright, point sized objects to my scenes, that were rendered as wu-pixels. When a hemicube was rendered, they would
appear in the hemicube as bright points, thus shining light onto patches.

They almost worked, but were subject to some unacceptable artifacts. The scene on the right was lit by three point spot lights; two on the pillars at the back, and one near the top-left, pointing towards the camera. The scene appears fine from this angle, but nasty artifacts are apparent if I turn the camera around.

You can see, on the
bottom image, three dark lines along the wall and floor. These were caused by the the light source seeming to get lost at the very edges
of the hemicubes. Perhaps this wouldn't have been so bad if I'd got my maths absolutely perfect and the edges of the hemicubes matched perfectly, but I'm sure that there would still have been noticable artifacts.<p>

So, rather than rendering the point lights onto the hemicubes, you can use ray tracing to cast the light from point sources onto
patches.

</p><h2>Optimising with 3D Rendering Hardware <img src="./TGLTLSBFSSP  Radiosity_files/gef2.gif" width="150" height="88" alt="Graphics Card"></h2>
One of the good things about Radiosity is that it's quite easy to optimise using any 32-bit
3D rendering hardware. As long as you can make it do straight texture mapping, with no
shading, anti-aliasing, or mip-mapping, etc.
<p>
How you go about this optimisation might not be quite what you expect, but it works well,
letting the CPU and rendering hardware work together in parallel. The hardware handles the texture
mapping and hidden surface removal (z-buffering), and the CPU handles the rest of the radiosity.</p><p>

	As far as I know, there is no rendering hardware that deals with floating point lighting values,
	or even lighting values above 255. So there is no point trying to get them to directly render
	scenes with such lighting. However, with a little subtlety, you can get them to do the texture
	mapping and hidden surface removal, while you put the lighting back in with a simple, fast
	loop.</p><p>

	If 3D hardware can write 32-bit pixels to the screen, then it can be made to write 32-bit values
	representing anything we want. 3D hardware can't write actual floating point RGBs to the screen,
	but it can write 32-bit pointers to the patches that should be rendered there. Once it's done
	that, you simply need to take each pixel, and use it's 32-bit value as an address to locate the
	patch that should have been rendered there.

  <tbody><tr>
	<td>
	Here is one of the patch maps from the scene above. Each pixel has a floating point value for Red,
	Green and Blue. And so 3D hardware will not be able to deal with this directly.

	<td>
	Now this is another map. It looks totally weird, but ignore how it looks for now. Each pixel in this
	map is actually a 32-bit value, which is the address of the corresponding pixel on the left.<p>
	The reason the colours appear is because the lowest three bytes in the address are interpreted
	as colours.
	</p></td>

<table width="100%" border="0">
<tbody><tr><td>
Once you make a whole set of these <b>pointer textures</b> (one for each surface in your scene), you can
give them to the 3D hardware to render with them. The scene it comes out with will look something like this (right).<p>

The scene looks totally odd, but you can make out surfaces covered with patterns similar to the one above.
The pixels should not be interpreted as colours, but as pointers. If your graphics card used 32-bit textures, then they will be in a form something like ARGB, with A, R G and B being 8-bit values. Ignore
this structure and treat each pixel as a 32-bit value. Use them as memory pointers back to the patches
that should be there, and recreate the scene properly with patches.</p><p>

<b>Important:</b> You <i>must</i> make sure that you render the scene purely texture mapped. That means: <b>NO linear interpolation,
NO anti-aliasing, NO motion blur, NO shading/lighting, NO Mip Mapping, NO Fog, NO Gamma Correction</b> or anything else that isn't just a straight texture map. If you
do not do this, the adresses produced will not point to the correct place, and your code will almost certainally crash.

It should be clear how this optimises radiosity calculations. If it's not obvious, let me know and I'll try and add some more
explanation.

<p></p><hr><p>

<!--
You should be able to see that radiosity is hardly more complicated than
texture mapping, and so if you can write your own basic texture mapping engine,
then you can write your own radiosity renderer.<p>
If you have tried texture mapping before, it was probably either the 8-bit
palette or 24-bit RGB variety. This is different; 8 bits for each of R, G
and B are not enough. Radiosity simulates real-world lighting levels. For
example the sky is about 100 times the brightness of a lightbulb, and the
sun is 300,000 times the brightness of the sky. So you see that trying to
to cope with such a huge range, then limiting yourself to 0-255 is not
enough. You really need to -->


</p><p></p><hr><p>

</p><h2>Misunderstanding and Confusion:</h2>
<h3>(What to do with the image once you've rendered it)</h3>
The output of a radiosity renderer is an image where each pixel consists of three floating point values, one for each of red, green
and blue. The range of brightness values in this image may well be vast. As I have said before, the brightness of the sky is very much
greater than the brightness of an average surface indoors. And the sun is thousands of times brighter than that. What do you do with
such an image?<p> 

Your average monitor can at best produce only dim light, not a lot brighter than a surface indoors. Clearly you cannot display your
image directly on a monitor. To do this would require a monitor that could produce light as bright as the sun, and a graphics card
with 32 bits per channel. These things don't exist for technical, not to mention safety, issues. So what can you do?</p><p>

Most people seem to be happy to look at photographs and accept them as faithful representations of reality. They are wrong. Photographs
are no better than monitors for displaying real-life bright images. Photographs cannot give off light as bright as the sun, but people
never question their realism. Now this is where confusion sets in.</p><p>

</p><h3>Human Vision</h3>
Our vision is just about the most important sense we have. Every day I trust my life to it, and so far it hasn't got me killed.
Frequently it has saved my life and limb. This was an important sense for our ancestors too, right back to the very first fish or
whatever we evolved from.  Our eyeballs have had a long time to evolve and have been critical in our survival, and so they have become
very good indeed. They are sensitive to very low light levels (the dimmest flash you can see is as dim as 5 photons), and yet can cope
with looking at the very bright sky. Our eyeballs are not the only parts of our vision, perhaps even more important is the brain
behind them. An increadibly sophisticated piece circuitry, poorly understood, and consisting of many layers of processing takes the
output of our eyeballs and converts it to a sense of what actually exists infront of us. The brain has to be able to recognise the same
objects no matter how they are lit, and actually does an amazing job of compensating for the different types of lighting we encounter.
We don't even notice a difference when we walk from the outdoors lit by a bright blue sky, to the indoors lit by dim yellow lightbulbs.
If you've ever tried to take photos in these two conditions, you may have had to change to a different type of film to stop your pictures
coming out yellow and dark.<p>

Try this: Go out in a totally overcast day. Stand infront of something white. If you look at the clouds, you will see them as being grey,
but look at the white object, and it appears to be white. So what? Well the white thing is lit by the grey clouds and so can't possibly
be any brighter than them (in fact it will be darker), and yet we still perceive it to be white. If you don't believe me, take a photo
showing the white thing and the sky in the background. You will see that the white thing looks darker than the clouds.</p><p>

<u>Don't trust your eyes:</u> They are a hell of a lot smarter than you are.</p><p>

So what can you do? Well, since people are so willing to accept photographs as representations of reality we can take the output of
the renderer, which is a physical model of the light in a scene, and process this with a rough approximation of a camera film. I have
already written an article on this: <a href="http://freespace.virgin.net/hugo.elias/graphics/x_posure.htm">Exposure</a>, so I will say no more about it here.
